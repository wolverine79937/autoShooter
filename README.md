# autoShooter
This is a new concept for me. Compatibility with distributions...

This version of SFMShooter uses a "recursive make" model. It also has a "dist" make command to zip everything up and prepare it for redistribution through a website or some such. There is also the standard "clean" command and "all" commands.

I should add in a make "help" command.
